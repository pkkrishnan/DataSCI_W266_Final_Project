# DataSCI_W266_Final_Project
NLP Final Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the datasets, model codes and final report for the DataSci W266 Final NLP Project.

## Dataset
MediaSum data set on Hugging Face is used for model evaluation. This large-scale media interview dataset contains 463.6K transcripts with abstractive summaries, collected from interview transcripts and overview/topic descriptions from NPR and CNN. For our study, we restricted the dataset size to 1,000 examples for extractive summarization and 100 for abstractive summarization due to computational limitations. CNN / Daily Mail dataset was also used for comparative purposes given its narrative non-conversational structured nature.
